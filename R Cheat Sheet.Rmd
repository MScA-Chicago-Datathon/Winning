# 1.  Data type
R has a wide variety of data types including scalars, vectors (numerical, character, logical), matrices, data frames, and lists.

## 1.1 Vectors
```{r}
# vectors
a <- c(1,2,5.3,6,-2,4) # numeric vector
b <- c("one","two","three") # character vector
c <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) #logical vector


# Refer to elements of a vector using subscripts.
a[c(2,4)] # 2nd and 4th elements of vector
b[1:3] # 1st-3rd element of vector
```

## 1.2 Matrix

```{r}
# generates 5 x 4 numeric matrix 
(y<-matrix(1:20, nrow=5,ncol=4))
(y<-matrix(1:20, nrow=5,ncol=4,byrow = TRUE)) # byrow is False by default

# another example
cells <- c(1,26,24,68)
rnames <- c("R1", "R2")
cnames <- c("C1", "C2") 
mymatrix <- matrix(cells, nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE,
  dimnames=list(rnames, cnames))
mymatrix

# Identify rows, columns or elements using subscripts.
y
y[,4] # 4th column of matrix
y[3,] # 3rd row of matrix 
y[2:4,1:3] # rows 2,3,4 of columns 1,2,3
```

## 1.3 Array

Array is similar to Matrix but have higher dimentions

```{r}
# Create two vectors of different lengths.
vector1 <- c(5,9,3)
vector2 <- c(10,11,12)
vector3 <- c(13,14,15)

vector4 <- c(1:9)
vector5 <- c(1:15)

column.names <- c("COL1","COL2","COL3")
row.names <- c("ROW1","ROW2","ROW3")
matrix.names <- c("Matrix1","Matrix2")

# Take these vectors as input to the array.
(result <- array(c(vector1,vector2,vector3),dim = c(3,3,2),dimnames = list(row.names,column.names,
   matrix.names)))
(result2 <- array(vector4,dim = c(3,3,2)))
(result3 <- array(vector5,dim = c(3,3,2)))
dim(result)

# Identify the elements
result[3,,2] #the third row of the second matrix of the array.
result[1,3,1] #the element in the 1st row and 3rd column of the 1st matrix.
result[,,2] #the 2nd Matrix.

```

## 1.4 Data Frame

A data frame is more general than a matrix, in that different columns can have different modes (numeric, character, factor, etc.). This is similar to SAS and SPSS datasets.

```{r}
d <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
e <- c("red", "white", "red", NA, "gray")
f <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE, TRUE)
g <- seq(from = 0.1, to = 0.5, by = 0.1)
h <- rep(1,5)
mydata <- data.frame(d,e,f,g,h)
names(mydata) <- c("ID","Color","Passed","c4","c5") # variable names
mydata

# A variety of ways to identify the elements of a data frame .
mydata[3:5] # columns 3,4,5 of data frame
mydata[c("ID","Color")] # columns ID and Age from data frame
mydata$c4 # variable x1 in the data frame
mydata[,4] # same as above
class(mydata$c4) #as a numeric vector
class(mydata[4]) #as a data frame
mydata[1:2,] #rows as a data frame
```

## 1.5 List

An ordered collection of objects (components). A list allows you to gather a variety of (possibly unrelated) objects under one name. List can contain vectors with different length.

```{r}
# example of a list with 4 components - 
# a string, a numeric vector, a matrix, and a scaler 
list1 <- list(name="Fred", mynumbers=a, mymatrix=y, age=5.3, scores = c(1:4) )
list2 <- as.list(mydata)

# example of a list containing two lists 
mylist <- c(list1,list2)
class(mylist)

#fetch the components of list
mylist[1:3] # subset the list
mylist["mynumbers"] # subset the list
mylist[[2]] # fetch out the 2nd component of the list, as numeric vector
mylist[["mynumbers"]] # component named mynumbers in list
mylist$mynumbers

```

## 1.6 factor

Tell R that a variable is nominal by making it a factor

```{r}
# variable gender with 2 "male" entries and 3 "female" entries 
(gender <- c(rep("male",2), rep("female", 3)))
(gender <- factor(gender))
summary(gender)

# stores gender as 20 1s and 30 2s and associates
# 1=female, 2=male internally (alphabetically)
(gender <- c(rep(1,2), rep(2,3)))
(gender <- factor(gender, levels = c(1,2), labels = c("male", "female")))
summary(gender)

# ordinal vectors
rating <- c(1,3,5,3,5,1)
(rating <- ordered(rating))
(rating <- ordered(rating,levels = c(1,3, 5),labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High")))
summary(rating)
```

## 1.7 Transformation between data types

```{r}
# between vectors
(a1 <- as.character(a)) # from number to charactor 
(a2 <- toString(a)) # from printing result to charactor
(a3 <- as.factor(a)) # from interval to nomimal 
(a4 <- as.ordered(a))# To ordinal 
as.numeric(c) # logical vector can be converted to 1,0

# data frame and vectors
class(df1 <- as.data.frame(mymatrix))
class(v1 <- as.data.frame(mymatrix[1,]))
class(as.data.frame(mymatrix[1,]))
class(mymatrix[1,])
dim(mymatrix[1,])
mymatrix[,1]
as.data.frame(mymatrix[1,]) # convert vector to data frame, into columns
dim(as.data.frame(mymatrix[1,]))

```

## 1.8 Other data types

Besides `numeric`, `logic`, `character`, there are more data types like `integer`, `date`, `POSIXct` and `POSIXt` for time. 

`Table` is a special data type which is also a function. 

### Date

```{r}
# use as.Date( ) to convert strings to dates 
mydates <- as.Date(c("2007-06-22", "2004-02-13"))
# number of days between 6/22/07 and 2/13/04 
(days <- mydates[1] - mydates[2])

# Sys.Date() return today's date, and date() return date and time
(Date.with.time <- date())
(Today <- Sys.Date())
(Lastweek <- Today - 7)

# change the format of date
format(Today, format = "%B %d %Y")
format(Today, format = "%b %d %y")
format(Today, format = "%m %d %y")
format(Today, format = "%a %m %d %y")

# convert dates to character data
(strDates <- as.character(Today))
class(strDates)
# convert character to dates
(Today <- as.Date(strDates))
class(Today)
```

### Time

```{r}
#Sys.time() return current time
(Now <- Sys.time())
class(Now)
Now
(TenMinutesAgo <- Now - 10)
```



## 1.9 Other useful function
```{r}
length(a) # number of elements or components
str(mylist)    # structure of an object 
class(mylist)  # class or type of an object
names(mylist)  # names

c(a,b)       # combine objects into a vector
cbind(a,a,a) # combine objects as columns
rbind(a,a,a) # combine objects as rows 


ls()       # list current objects
rm(x) # delete an object

head(mydata, n = 3)
```
